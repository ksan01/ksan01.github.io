Assignment 1 
README

I believe that I implemented all the tasks in the assignment correctly.
One thing I could improve is that I could use Git more often which is good coding practice.
I did not colloborate with anyone while completing this assignment.
The thing I was most stuck in this assingment was that I could not make my image appear on my website as desired. This is probably due to an error specifying the file path of the image. After spending quite a while trying to debug this issue I noticed that I had typed .JPG with lowercase.
I spent approximately 3-4 hours for this assignment.
