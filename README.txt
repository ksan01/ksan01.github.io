Assignment 1 
README

The one thing I did wrong in this assignment was that I forgot to use Git constantly and just added and pushed the final version of my files. I am aware that this is not a good practice in coding and will use Git more constantly in future assignments. 
I did not colloborate with anyone while completing this assignment.
The thing I was most stuck in this assingment was that I could not make my image appear on my website as desired. This was due to an error specifying the file path of the image.
