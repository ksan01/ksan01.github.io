	<h1>A Short Bio</h1>
	<p class="bio">I was born on 24 February 1999 in Istanbul, Turkey to family of a financial advisor, my father, and a banker, my mother. My parents always tell me that I was a such a quite and easy-to-handle baby who would cause minimal trouble to them. They say that I would often zone out and quietly start pondering some thoughts, an activity, I would admit, I do quite often till this day. I started my pre-school education at Aci, the school I would remain in since I graduated from its high school. During my primary and middle school days, I discovered several interest in sports and music such as soccer, basketball, drums, and guitar. From these interest, I can still say that I am a soccer enthusiast and still play the guitar in my spare time. I consider myself as a hard-working and ambitious student with good grades since this period. During the first two years of high school, I was always the skinniest and  smallest kid in class. However, the last two years saw me grow a lot both physically and also mentally. I would consider this time as probably the most pivotal years that shaped who I am today. I learned valuable skills such as discipline, ambition, and conception that helped me got accepted to my dream college. Right now, I am a second-year student at Tufts University studying Computer Science in the School of Engineering. I would say that my college years so far has been nothing less than great; actively exploring new academic and social interest, figuring out who I want to be and what I want to do in the future and trying to be a better version of myself in the meantime. I am sure that I will continue on chasing these goals throughout my life.</p>
